# üìå Project Overview

Inx Future Inc. is a global company aiming to improve employee satisfaction, retention, and performance.
This dataset captures employee-related information, including demographics, performance ratings, promotions, awards, and turnover status.

## The primary goals of this project are:

1) To analyze workforce patterns.

2) To predict employee attrition (whether an employee will leave).

3) To identify key factors influencing promotions and performance.

4) To assist HR teams in taking data-driven decisions for employee management.

# üìÇ Dataset Description

The dataset contains information about employees across multiple departments.

## Key Columns (may vary slightly depending on source):

1) Employee ID ‚Üí Unique identifier.

2) Department ‚Üí Department of employee.

3) Education ‚Üí Qualification level.

4) Joining Year ‚Üí Year employee joined.

5) City ‚Üí Work location.

6) Age ‚Üí Age of employee.

7) Gender ‚Üí Male/Female.

8) EverBenched ‚Üí Whether employee was ever on bench (Yes/No).

9) ExperienceInCurrentDomain ‚Üí Years of domain experience.

10) LeaveOrNot ‚Üí Target variable (1 = employee left, 0 = retained).
